                    &#34;Standing there, gaping at this monstrous and inhumane spectacle of rock and cloud and sky and space, 
                I feel a ridiculous greed and possessiveness come over me. 
                I want to know it all, posess it all, embrace the entire scene intimately, deeply, totally...&#34;

                   <h2>The Plan</h2>
                   <p>Picture this: it's early 2020, there are only slight hints of the chaos to come. No one has predicted the end of the world as we know it,
                       so what better time for a roadtrip! As avid explorers, my boyfriend and I planned my first ever visit to the magical red rocks
                       of eastern Utah. While taking the scenic route we made a few very important stops along the way (Did that sign just say alpaca farm!? Pull over!).
                       As March approched, right at the cusp of disaster, we we loaded up the car with camping gear and more snacks than anyone should ever consume, then began our adventure. Final destination: Moab, Utah.

                   <h2>Leadville, CO</h2>
                   <p>After enduring the desolate, windmill studded landscape of Kansas and a brief overnight stay in Denver
                    we veered slightly off course to visit the quant town of Leadville, CO. Nestled in the mountains, the
                    town is well known for it's high elevation (10,200 feet to be exact) and mountain biking trails,but we made
                    pit stop for a little store called Melanzana. Their handmade outdoor clothing is the best of it's kind AND you
                    can't get in anywhere else. When we arrived we found the streets were transformed into
                    snow covered slopes and horsback riders almost outnumbered the tourists. We'd stumbled into their skijorning festival
                    a sport during which a skiier is pulled by horse along the track, over ramps and other obstacles. After watching
                    the festivites and grabbing a few amazingly cozy Mellys we continued our journey. </p>

                    <h2>Moab, UT</h2>
                    <p>This small town, surrounded by national park land, was our base of operations
                        for the next three days and man, was it perfect. Local businesses line the (only slightly gaudy) desert themed streets, all of
                        which were easily within walking distance of our hotel. It was the perfect spot to return to after a long
                        day of hiking and exploration.</p>

                    <h2>Arches, National Park</h2>
                    <p>At the break of dawn, the best place to watch the sunrise over red rock
                        formations, is by far at Arches. We hiked up to the Delicate Arch, the park’s most iconic rock formation, at day
                        break. With a spectacular view of the entire park from above, the trail was well worth the elevation
                        gain. After that initial trail, we drove around the park and completed a few shorter trails. An entire day is easily
                    spent within this massive park.</p>

                    <h2>Hauer Ranch</h2>
                    <p>I can't think of a better way to explore western landscape than on horseback. We went
                        on a ride into remote BLM land to see breathtaking views of the landscape. The tour took us
                        through several set locations for famous western films, the most notable being John Wayne film “Rio
                        Grande.”</p>

                 <h2>Off the Beaten Path</h2>
                    <p>Beginning in Moab, the Upper Colorado River Scenic Byway (Route 128) follows the Colorado River through a breathtaking valley.
                        Along this route, we found a short hike through the canyon that led to a small natural bridge. The route also meandered through
                        vast ranchland with the La Sal mountain range looming in the background. 
                    </p>

                <h2>Homeward Bound</h2>
                   <p>After 3 days in Moab, it was time to begin the treck home. Needless to say, we took the long way. We decided to make a
                       pit stop in Durango, CO as well as a quick visit to the Great Sand Dunes National Park. Both stops were well worth the
                       hours added to our drive. The dunes were massive and beautiful. If we'd had more time, we would've grabbed a sled and 
                       (which the park provided) and flown down the dunes. But, that will have to wait until next time! 
                   </p>

                            The trip highlighted above was slightly less adventurous than previously planned (originally we were backpacking through slot canyons and camping our way through Utah)due to an ill-timed cold, but it was still a great way to 
                            experience the magic of Utah. With a background in conservation, I love experiencing the vast and diverse landscapes nation-wide.</div>
